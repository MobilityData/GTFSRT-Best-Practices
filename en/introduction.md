# GTFS-realtime Data Best Practices

## Introduction

These are recommended practices for describing real-time public transportation information in the [GTFS-realtime](https://gtfs.org/reference/realtime/v2/) data format.

### Document Structure

Recommended practices are organized into two primary sections

* __[Practice Recommendations Organized by Message](#practice-recommendations-organized-by-message):__ Recommendations are organized by message and field in the same order described in the official GTFS-realtime reference.
* __[Practice Recommendations Organized by Case](#practice-recommendations-organized-by-case):__ With particular cases, such as frequency-based service, practices may need to be applied across several messages and fields and even with the corresponding GTFS package. Such recommendations are consolidated in this section.
